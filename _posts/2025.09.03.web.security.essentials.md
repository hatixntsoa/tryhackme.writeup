## Introduction

When you visit a website, your browser sends a request to a web server. The server processes the request, verifies access, and returns a response to the user. This response can be a webpage, an image, or data like search results or your account information. This request-response cycle is the foundation of how the web functions. Attackers can abuse this request-response cycle by overwhelming servers with requests, bypassing access controls, or even tricking the server into executing harmful commands.

### Components of a Web Service

For example, any web service, like [tryhackme.com](https://tryhackme.com/), requires three main components to function.
- **Application**: The code, images, styles, and icons that dictate how the website looks and functions.
- **Web Server**: This component hosts the application. It listens for requests and returns a response to the user.
- **Host Machine**: The underlying operating system, Linux or Windows, that runs the web server and the application.

In the next task, we will investigate the security measures available to protect these three components.

### Web Servers

When you visit a website, your web browser sends a request to a web server, as discussed above. Web servers listen for incoming requests and return an appropriate response. Web servers are positioned in front of websites and applications, making them a crucial aspect of the internet's foundation. Because they are publicly exposed and handle all incoming web requests, web servers are a common target for attackers.

Here are some of the most common web servers that you will encounter.

- **[Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/)**: The most popular web server to host simple websites and blogs, most commonly [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/).
- **[Nginx](https://nginx.org/)**: An industry standard for high-performance web apps. Used by companies like [Netflix](https://openconnect.netflix.com/en/appliances/#software), Airbnb, and GitHub.
- **[Internet Information Services](https://www.iis.net/) (IIS)**: A Microsoft-developed web server commonly used in enterprise environments.

## Protecting the Web

### Best Practices

Various security measures are available when securing websites and web applications. Some solutions provide visibility, while others can actively stop or limit an attack, commonly known as mitigation. Referencing Task 3, where we discussed the three essential components of any web service: the **application**, the **web server**, and the **host machine**, let's now examine the protections available for each of these components.

**Protecting the Application**

- Secure Coding: Avoid insecure functions, ensure proper handling of errors, and remove sensitive information.
- Input Validation & Sanitization: Validate and sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks.
- Access Control: Restrict access based on user roles.

**Protecting the Web Server**

- Logging: Keep a detailed record of all web requests with access logs.
- Web Application Firewall (WAF): Filter and block harmful traffic based on defined rules.
- Content Delivery Network (CDN): Reduce direct exposure to your server and use integrated WAFs.

**Protecting the Host Machine**

- Least Privilege: Use low-privilege users for services.
- System Hardening: Disable unnecessary services and close unused ports.
- Antivirus: Add endpoint-level protection that blocks known malware.

**Security Tips for All Three Components**

- Strong Authentication: Don't just let anyone access your code, admin panels, or host machine.
- Patch Management: Ensure your app dependencies, web server, and host machine are up to date.

### Logging

Web servers can create logs for every request they receive. We call these access logs, and they are incredibly valuable from a security perspective because they track information about every interaction with the server, including the client's IP address, timestamp, requested page or data, response status from the server, and user agent. These fields can play an important role in investigations, helping analysts detect potential malicious activity and trace attacker behavior.

Let's take a look at a benign series of events that we might find in an access log to get a feel for the type of data we can observe.  
Note that `GET` requests are used to retrieve a resource from the server, like a specific web page.  
`POST` requests are used to submit data to the server, such as login credentials.

1. The user, from the client IP `10.10.10.100`, visits the website's homepage at `/index.html`.
2. Next, they navigate to the login page at `/login.html`.
3. They then enter their credentials and submit the form, signified by the `POST` request.
4. Finally, they access their account page at `/myaccount.html`.

Although this series of events is expected and not out of the ordinary, you can see how the verbosity of these logs can help analysts and incident responders reconstruct a possible attack sequence.

## Defense Systems

### Content Delivery Network (CDN)

**CDNs** store and serve cached content from servers closer to the user to reduce latency. Imagine you have a main server housed in a central location. This main server provides information to edge servers worldwide so your customers can access data more quickly and safely. Aside from speed, CDNs also help in a security sense by acting as a buffer between the user and the origin server.

**Security Benefits**

- IP Masking: Hides the origin server IP address, which makes it harder for attackers to target.
- DDoS Protection: CDNs can absorb a large amount of traffic, making denial-of-service attacks less effective.
- Enforced HTTPS: Encrypted communication via TLS is enforced by default by most CDNs.
- Integrated WAF: Many CDNs, including [Cloudflare CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/), [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) & [Azure Front Door](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/front-door-overview), integrate web application firewalls.

In essence, CDNs allow web apps to deliver data to customers more efficiently and securely.

### Web Application Firewall (WAF)

**WAFs** are a powerful tool that can be integrated as another layer of protection for websites and web applications. They inspect incoming HTTP traffic and block or log potentially harmful requests based on security rules. Think of the analogy of a bouncer at a bar or club. Every person (web request) that wants to enter must be checked by the bouncer (firewall). Anyone (any request) that doesn't meet the standard requirement will be rejected.

Let's take a closer look at the types of WAFs available to us as defenders, then dive deeper into their functionality.

- Cloud-based (Reverse Proxy): Sits in front of the web server. These WAFs are easy to deploy and have great scalability.
- Host-based: Software deployed directly on the web server and offers control for each application.
- Network-based: A physical or virtual appliance situated on the network perimeter. More suited for enterprise environments.

**Functionality**

As stated above, WAFs inspect HTTP requests to detect anomalies, attacks, or known suspicious patterns. Below are some of the methods used, along with examples of requests that may be blocked.

| WAF Feature                        | Detection Method                              | Example                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Signature-Based Detection          | Matches known attack patterns or payloads     | A request with a User-Agent that matches a known tool, `sqlmap/1.8.1`       |
| Heuristic-Based Detection          | Analyzes the context and behavior of requests | A long query string with special characters `search?q=%3Cscript%20(1)`      |
| Anomaly & Behavioral Analysis      | Flags deviations from normal traffic behavior | A single IP address makes repeated login attempts in a short period of time |
| Location & IP Reputation Filtering | Uses location and threat intel to block IPs   | A request from an IP address that is outside of your normal business area   |

The above table is not exhaustive, as detection methods are constantly evolving, and custom rules can be created based on the specific needs of the web application owner.

Below is a screenshot of the Cloudflare dashboard for `tryhackme.thm`, focused on the security panel. In it, we can see all requests for the last 24 hours, including requests blocked by the integrated web application firewall.

### Antivirus (AV)

**AVs** are often misunderstood as a blanket protection measure, but they are primarily made to safeguard endpoints, such as desktops, laptops, and servers, from known malicious files and programs. Most AVs rely on signature-based detection, which means they compare files with a database of known malware or patterns.

While web attacks usually target the application layer, not the host machine, AVs still play an important role in host protection, as discussed in Task 3. They can help detect malicious file uploads, such as web shells, post-exploitation tools, and other malicious software. AVs are just one layer in a broader defense-in-depth strategy and should be combined with other security measures to provide stronger protection.

## Practice Scenario

Let's take a more hands-on look at the security measures you've learned about in this room by applying them to a real-world scenario. Your site, **Secure-A-Site**, is currently being developed and will be deployed soon. Your goal is to help prepare the web application, web server, and host machine for launch by ensuring they are as secure as possible. 

You'll work through the three layers and apply the best practices that you learned about in the previous tasks:

- Web Application
- Web Server
- Host Machine
